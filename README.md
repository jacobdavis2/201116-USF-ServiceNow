# Installation Guide
## Batch 201116-USF-ServiceNow

Hello and welcome to the installation guide for your upcoming batch! Normally, there would be a ton of software to have installed, but for you, there's only a few bits of software to grab since we are only doing frontend development and ServiceNow.

ServiceNow itself is a cloud service and as such requires no download or installation. However, we will be discussing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Angular, and the environment being used for instruction has certain things installed to enhance this experience.

The software covered here includes:
1. **Git Bash** (optional)
2. **Visual Studio Code** (as an IDE, or integrated development environment)
3. **NodeJS** for npm (for Angular)

## Git Bash
Git is a version control management and source code management tool written by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux (hence the name). While a ton of time won't be spent on this topic, Git is still highly prevalent in the industry and exposure to it is always good. 

- If you want to experiment with Git alongside the instructor, you can download the bash here: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- You can make an account on GitHub to push to here: https://github.com/

## Visual Studio Code
VS Code is a popular lightweight IDE that is great for frontend programming thanks to its excellent IntelliSense (autocomplete). Don't get it confused with Visual Studio Community, which is a much heavier IDE for enterprise backend and app development in .NET.

All HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript will be edited in VSCode. 
- You can download it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/

## NodeJS
NodeJS is a runtime for JavaScript and has some other handy features, but that's not why we use it. It comes with a package manager, a tool that allows users to easily install other people's libraries, called **Node Package Manager**, or npm for short.

The NodeJS install process is a bit lengthy, so if you only do one of these early, do this one. 
- You can initiate it here: https://nodejs.org/en/
